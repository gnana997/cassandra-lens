## Contributing Code

### Development Setup

**Prerequisites:**
- Node.js 22.x or higher
- VS Code 1.105.0 or higher
- Git
- Access to a Cassandra cluster (for testing)

**Fork and Clone:**

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/cassandra-lens.git
cd cassandra-lens/cassandra-lens-vs-ext
```

**Install Dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

**Development Workflow:**

```bash
# Compile TypeScript and watch for changes
npm run watch

# In VS Code, press F5 to launch Extension Development Host
# The extension will automatically reload on file changes
```

**Test Your Changes:**

1. Connect to a Cassandra cluster in the Extension Development Host
2. Test all affected functionality
3. Verify no TypeScript errors: `npm run compile`
4. Run linter: `npm run lint`

### Pull Request Process

**1. Create a Feature Branch:**

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

**Branch Naming:**
- Features: `feature/add-query-export`
- Bug fixes: `fix/connection-timeout`
- Docs: `docs/update-readme`

**2. Make Your Changes:**

- Write clean, readable code
- Follow existing patterns and conventions
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Keep commits focused and atomic

**3. Commit Your Changes:**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add CSV export for query results"
```

**Commit Message Format:**
- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation only
- `refactor:` Code refactoring (no functional changes)
- `perf:` Performance improvement
- `test:` Adding tests
- `chore:` Build/tooling changes

**4. Push to Your Fork:**

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

**5. Open a Pull Request:**

1. Go to the [original repository](https://github.com/gnana997/cassandra-lens)
2. Click "New Pull Request"
3. Select your fork and branch
4. Fill out the PR template completely
5. Link related issues (e.g., "Fixes #123")

**6. Code Review:**

- Wait for maintainer review (usually within 3-5 days)
- Address feedback and make requested changes
- Push new commits to your branch (PR will update automatically)
- Once approved, your PR will be merged!

### Code Style Guidelines

**TypeScript:**
- Use TypeScript strict mode features
- Prefer `const` over `let`, avoid `var`
- Use meaningful variable names (`connectionProfile`, not `cp`)
- Add JSDoc comments for public methods and classes

**Example:**

```typescript
/**
 * Connects to a Cassandra cluster with the given connection profile.
 *
 * @param profile - The connection profile containing cluster details
 * @returns Cluster metadata including name and version
 * @throws {Error} If connection fails or times out
 */
async connect(profile: ConnectionProfile): Promise<ClusterMetadata> {
  // Implementation
}
```

**Formatting:**
- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use single quotes for strings
- Add trailing commas in multi-line objects/arrays
- Run `npm run lint` before committing

**File Organization:**
- Group imports: external packages ‚Üí internal modules ‚Üí types
- Keep files focused (one class/concept per file)
- Use descriptive file names (`connectionManager.ts`, not `mgr.ts`)

---

### Testing

**Manual Testing:**

1. Press F5 to launch Extension Development Host
2. Test your changes with:
   - Different Cassandra versions (3.11, 4.0, 4.1)
   - Various scenarios (fresh install, existing connections, etc.)
   - Edge cases (empty results, errors, timeouts)

**What to Test:**
- Connection management (add, edit, delete, connect, disconnect)
- Query execution (single statement, multi-statement, selection, @conn)
- Schema browsing (expand/collapse, refresh, copy operations)
- CodeLens display (different modes, connection switches)
